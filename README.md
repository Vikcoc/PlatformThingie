# PlatformThingie
Want to dive into building and hosting a microservices app.

Notes on the process should be in the wiki.

## Platform concept
Should have a microservices platform that maintaines inventory

Outlines should be:
1. Log in with providers like Google, Microsoft, etc.
2. Manage users and access rights in one service.
3. Manage inventory and export necessary rights to previous app.
4. Manage aquisitions and export purchased products to previous app and necessary rights to first app.
5. Manage disposal and import inventory from second app and export necessary rights to first app.
