# PlatformThingie
A project to develop a microservices app from A to Z.
A short documentation of the steps it took can be found in the [WIKI](https://github.com/Vikcoc/PlatformThingie/wiki).

## Platform concept
Should have a microservices platform that maintaines inventory

Outlines should be:
1. Log in with providers like Google, Microsoft, etc.
2. Manage users and access rights in one service.
3. Manage inventory.
4. Manage the specification of the items held in the inventory, and the access rights required.

## Some things to fix
- The unit tests.
- One of the dapper queries that is generating parameters instead of inserting arrays.
- Style and JavaScript files should be consolidated.
- Probably others.
